# SSL Certificate Expiry Monitoring

Prevent website downtime, lost business, and reputation damage. TrackSSL monitors your SSL/TLS certificates for expiration, changes, and fraudulent certs.

## Features

- Set up SSL expiry notifications
  - As your SSL/TLS certificate nears expiration, TrackSSL will send you notifications via email, Slack, SMS, Teams, and more. Are you certain your Let’s Encrypt cron job is running?
- Monitor SSL Changes
  - Keep tabs on your hosting provider or SSL certificate renewal automation. TrackSSL notifies you whenever your SSL certificate changes. When your certificate is updated, we’ll notify you.
- SSL Certificate Transparency Alerts
  - Get instantly notified whenever a new SSL certificate is issued for your domain. Certificate Transparency Logs give you critical visibility to protect your brand from fraudulent certs.

## Why Monitor SSL Certificates?

- Website or service downtime
  - Expired certificates will cause website downtime. Nowadays, users will just turn away and say your site is down.
- Revenue and reputation loss
  - After a certificate has expired your new and existing customer will see a notification saying that your website is insecure. Users won’t fill forms, register, or purchase on you website, and might even go to your competitors.
- Google rankings and SEO
  If your certificate is expired, Google can lower your rankings.
